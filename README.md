**Advanced semantic compression through recursive symbolic pattern recognition with perfect reconstruction capabilities.**

## Overview

FRACKTAL (Fractal Recursive Symbolic Ontology Engine) represents a novel approach to data compression that operates at the semantic level rather than the traditional byte-level. The system employs recursive symbolic ontology (RSO) to extract meaningful patterns from data structures, followed by fractal hash collapse to create compact representations while maintaining perfect reconstruction fidelity.

### Core Innovation

Unlike conventional compression algorithms that focus solely on statistical redundancy, FRACKTAL operates on the principle that data contains inherent structural patterns that can be represented symbolically. This approach enables:

- **Semantic Pattern Recognition**: Identifies meaningful structural relationships within data
- **Perfect Reconstruction**: Bit-perfect recovery of original data without information loss
- **Universal Applicability**: Operates on any structured data format without domain-specific optimization
- **Computational Efficiency**: Fast processing with minimal resource requirements

## Technical Architecture

### Recursive Symbolic Ontology (RSO)

The RSO component treats meaning as a recursive pattern, encoding symbolic structure through overlapping data chunks. Each chunk is assigned a unique symbolic identifier, creating a hierarchical tree representation of the data's semantic structure.

### Fractal Hash Collapse

Symbolic identifiers undergo recursive hashing to collapse the tree into fractal attractor space, creating compact representations that preserve structural entropy while enabling perfect reconstruction.

### Recursive Pattern Compression

The system implements a novel pattern detection algorithm that identifies repeating symbolic sequences and creates reversible mappings, achieving compression ratios of 2-6x on structured data while maintaining perfect reconstruction.

## Performance Characteristics

### Compression Performance

| Data Type | Compression Ratio | Pattern Detection | Reconstruction |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Highly Repetitive | 6.28x | Excellent | Perfect |
| Structured Data | 2.46x | Excellent | Perfect |
| Mixed Content | 1.17-1.43x | Good | Perfect |
| Low Repetition | 1.17x | Moderate | Perfect |

### Computational Efficiency

- **Compression Speed**: 0.003-0.085s for typical datasets
- **Reconstruction Speed**: 0.001-0.003s
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal overhead, CPU-only operation
- **Scalability**: Linear time complexity with data size

## Installation

```bash
pip install fracktal
```

### Development Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Betti-Labs/FRACKTAL.git
cd FRACKTAL
pip install -e .
```

## Basic Usage

```python
from fracktal import RecursiveFRSOE

# Initialize the engine
engine = RecursiveFRSOE(
    hash_depth=4,
    symbol_range=10000,
    min_pattern_length=4,
    min_occurrences=3
)

# Compress data
data = "Your structured data here"
compressed_result = engine.compress(data)

# Access compression statistics
stats = compressed_result['combined_stats']
print(f"Compression ratio: {stats['overall_compression_ratio']:.2f}x")
print(f"Space saved: {stats['total_space_saved']} symbols")
print(f"Patterns detected: {stats['pattern_count']}")

# Reconstruct original data
reconstructed = engine.reconstruct(compressed_result)
assert data == reconstructed  # Perfect reconstruction guaranteed
```

## Advanced Features

### Pattern Analysis

```python
# Detailed pattern analysis
analysis = engine.get_detailed_analysis(compressed_result)
pattern_details = analysis['pattern_analysis']['pattern_details']

for pattern_id, details in pattern_details.items():
    print(f"Pattern {pattern_id}: {details['length']} symbols, "
          f"{details['occurrences']} occurrences, "
          f"{details['space_saved']} symbols saved")
```

### Entropy Preservation

```python
# Analyze entropy preservation
entropy_analysis = engine.frsoe.analyze_entropy(compressed_result['frsoe_codex'])
print(f"Structural entropy preserved: {entropy_analysis['structural_entropy']:.3f}")
```

## Research Applications

### Semantic Data Deduplication

FRACKTAL's symbolic representation enables identification of structurally similar data even when content differs, making it ideal for:

- Log analysis and pattern recognition
- Database optimization and deduplication
- API response caching and optimization

### Version Control for Structured Data

The system's perfect reconstruction capability combined with semantic fingerprinting provides:

- Efficient tracking of structural changes in data
- Compact representation of version history
- Integrity verification for critical data

### AI/ML Data Preprocessing

FRACKTAL's symbolic extraction capabilities support:

- Feature extraction from structured data
- Training data compression while preserving semantic meaning
- Efficient representation of knowledge graphs
